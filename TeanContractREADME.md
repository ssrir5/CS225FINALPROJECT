# CS225FINALPROJECT
# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**: Our team will plan to meet every Tuesday and Thursday night for two hours from 6-8pm. Our main forms of communication will be through Zoom hosted meetings, text conversations, and occasional in-person conversations. Nimish will be in charge of taking notes during meetings and logging / recording the minutes spent in each meeting, which he will put on a Google Doc. We will also work together to draft the weekly Development Log. In the development log, we will identify what we accomplished, what lingering questions we have, and plan out our work for the week ahead. This will be done as a group effort with input from every group member.

2. **Assistance**: Our teammates will contact each other through text. We have all agreed to keep notfications on for our groupchat to keep quick and constant communication. Outside of emergencies, teammates should try to respond to each other as soon as possible or within a couple of hours. Since we all have agreed to work together on Tuesday's and Thursday's lingering questions can be asked and answered during those times in a group setting.

3. **Respect**: In our bi-weekly meetings, each teammate will act respectful towards each other's ideas, ensuring that everyone gets an adequate chance to share updates and developments. We will ask each member for their opinions and ideas regarding the project. Weâ€™ll ask each member about their problems that they faced, and offer each other solutions. In addition, we will make our decisions through majority opinion. In the cases of split decisions, we plan to continue talking out the idea until a final decision can be made.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**: We will decide our weekly deliverables as a team. We will each try and work on at least one deliverable and if the task for the week is large, we will work on the task in groups. We will also have code-reviews weekly and testing sessions to ensure that our code works as expected. Splitting up work will be done the week before during our last few minutes when working on the development log.

5. **Time Commitment**: We should put in at least 4-5 hours per week aside from meetings on this project. We will address unforeseen circumstances as they arrive, although we will communicate our deadlines with each other to ensure that an adequate amount of work is being done per week. In the case where someone runs into an issue, we will use our common meeting times on Tuesday and Thursday to look at it together in hopes of figuring out the issue.

6. **Conflict Resolution**: In terms of design conflicts, we will resolve situations with disagreements by looking at the pros and cons of each design decision and then make a decision through majority rule. In terms of work conflicts, If team members continually do not complete their tasks or are late, we will bring this up with our PM and then look for possible solutions. We will all try and keep each on task and motivated to solving the problems at hand.
